planner:
    planner v1: just deleted, it does not working, idk what i did here
    planner v2: sequential rollout
    planner v3: propagation (rollout) using fake thread
    planner v4: insert the propagation_model inside the planner >>> the plan step return the entire vector of act
                                                                    the responsability for re_plan should be in the main


optimizer:
    optimizer v1: base
    optimizer v2: vectorized (all to numpy array format, before: common list)
